## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### MCP Server Integration
The system integrates multiple MCP servers through different transport protocols:

- **Notes Server** (`servers/notes_server.py`): Local note management via stdio transport
- **Weather Server** (`servers/weather.py`): Weather data via HTTP transport (port 8000)
- **Browser MCPs** (`servers/browser_mcp.json`): Playwright, Airbnb, and DuckDuckGo via Node.js stdio

### Agent Architecture
- **LangGraph ReAct Agent**: Intelligent tool selection and execution
- **MultiServerMCPClient**: Unified interface for multiple MCP servers
- **Step-by-Step Tracing**: Real-time visibility into agent decision-making
- **Conversation Memory**: Maintains context across multiple interactions

### Data Persistence
- **Notes Storage**: JSON-based local storage in `data/notes.json`
- **Session Management**: Browser sessions persist across multi-step operations
- **Configuration**: MCP server configurations stored in JSON format

## üîß Configuration

### MCP Server Configuration
The `servers/browser_mcp.json` file configures Node.js-based MCP servers:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "playwright": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@playwright/mcp@latest"]
    },
    "airbnb": {
      "command": "npx", 
      "args": ["-y", "@openbnb/mcp-server-airbnb", "--ignore-robots-txt", "--session-persistent"]
    },
    "duckduckgo-search": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "duckduckgo-mcp-server"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Environment Variables
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key (required)
- `OPENAI_MODEL`: OpenAI model to use (default: gpt-4o)

### Adding New Capabilities
1. **Create MCP Server**: Implement new server in `servers/` directory
2. **Update Configuration**: Add server to connection configuration in `client.py`
3. **Update System Prompt**: Modify agent system guidance for new tools
4. **Test Integration**: Verify tool discovery and execution

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Browser Automation Not Working**
- Ensure Node.js is installed and accessible
- Check that Playwright MCP server is properly installed
- Verify browser automation commands start with "browse:"

**Weather Server Connection Issues**
- Weather server starts automatically on port 8000
- Check if port 8000 is available and not blocked by firewall
- Verify internet connectivity for weather API calls

**Notes Not Persisting**
- Check write permissions for `data/` directory
- Verify `data/notes.json` file is not corrupted
- Ensure sufficient disk space

**MCP Server Connection Failures**
- Verify all required npm packages are installed
- Check Node.js version compatibility
- Review MCP server configuration in `browser_mcp.json`

### Debug Mode
Enable debug mode for browser automation:
```bash
export PWDEBUG=1
export PLAYWRIGHT_HEADLESS=0
uv run client.py
```
